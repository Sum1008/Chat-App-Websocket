# Chat-Application-based-on-WebSocket
WebSocket is a communication protocol that makes it possible to establish a two-way communication channel between a server and a client.

WebSocket works by first establishing a regular HTTP connection with the server and then upgrading it to a bidirectional websocket connection by sending an Upgrade header.

WebSocket is supported in most modern web browsers and for browsers that donâ€™t support it, we have libraries that provide fallbacks to other techniques like comet and long-polling.

# Spring Boot WebSocket Chat Application

This project is a **real-time chat application** built with **Spring Boot** and **WebSockets**. It allows users to send and receive messages instantly without needing to refresh the page, providing a seamless and dynamic chat experience.

## Project Overview

The application utilizes **WebSocket** technology to enable full-duplex communication between the client and server, allowing users to send and receive messages in real-time. With the integration of **STOMP** and **SockJS**, this chat application ensures compatibility with various browsers and devices.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Communication**: Messages are instantly broadcast to all connected clients.
- **WebSocket Support**: Full-duplex communication over a persistent connection, providing fast message delivery.
- **STOMP Protocol**: Efficient message routing and delivery using the STOMP protocol over WebSocket.
- **Compatibility**: Uses **SockJS** to ensure that the application works even on browsers that don't support WebSockets natively.
- **Simple UI**: A clean and responsive frontend allowing users to type and send messages instantly.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: For building the backend and handling WebSocket connections.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server.
- **STOMP**: A messaging protocol used over WebSockets to structure message exchanges between the client and server.
- **SockJS**: A JavaScript library that provides a WebSocket-like object for browsers that don't support WebSockets natively.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the client-side logic, such as connecting to WebSocket, sending messages, and displaying received messages.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating a simple and user-friendly frontend.

## Project Structure

### 1. WebSocket Configuration
The WebSocket configuration class sets up the server-side behavior of WebSocket connections and message flow. It enables the WebSocket message broker and defines destinations for the clients to subscribe to and send messages to.

- **@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker**: Enables WebSocket messaging.
- **/topic**: Destination prefix for messages that clients subscribe to.
- **/app**: Destination prefix for messages that clients send to the server.
- **/chat**: The WebSocket endpoint where clients connect.

### 2. Message Controller
The message controller is responsible for handling incoming messages and broadcasting them to all connected clients.

- **SimpMessagingTemplate**: A Spring utility that is used to send messages to a specific destination, broadcasting the message to all clients subscribed to `/topic/messages`.

### 3. Frontend (HTML + JavaScript)
The frontend of the application is a simple HTML page where users can send and receive messages in real-time.

- **SockJS**: Ensures compatibility for WebSocket connections.
- **STOMP Client**: Allows clients to communicate with the server using the STOMP protocol.

### 4. Flow of Communication
1. **WebSocket Connection**: 
   - Clients connect to the `/chat` WebSocket endpoint, maintaining an open connection throughout their session.
   
2. **Message Flow**:
   - Clients send messages to the server via the `/app/send` endpoint.
   - The server broadcasts the message to all clients subscribed to `/topic/messages`.
   
3. **Client-Server Communication**:
   - Sending messages: The client sends messages using `stompClient.send("/app/send", {}, message)`.
   - Receiving messages: The client listens to the `/topic/messages` destination and displays messages instantly when they are received.

## How It Works

### 1. WebSocket Connection:
The application establishes a WebSocket connection between the client and the server at the `/chat` endpoint. The connection stays open for the duration of the session, allowing real-time, continuous communication.

### 2. Message Flow:
When a user types a message and presses "Send," the message is sent to the server via the `/app/send` endpoint. The server then broadcasts the message to all connected clients via the `/topic/messages` destination. All clients subscribed to this destination will receive the new message instantly.

### 3. Client-Server Communication:
- **Sending Messages**: 
  - The client sends messages using the following code: 
  ```javascript
  stompClient.send("/app/send", {}, message);
